 Comp_fixtures2.py

This small python script will grab data from api.football-data.org and display forthcoming fixtures
for 15 European Leagues

Python 3.x and dependencies are 'requests' and 'prettytable'.  These modules will need to be installed for the
script to run.

Two files are required

Comp_fixtures2.py - main program
getfooty.py - function for grabbing api data

The code is a little more elegant than the previous league script, but still needs some work.

Operation is pretty self explanatory, just run python3 Comp_fixtures2.py
